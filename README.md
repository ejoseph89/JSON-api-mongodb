## Project overview

- Returning JSON objects
  - Objects returned are links to individual pictures (10) from my perosnal instagram page
  - Each image has `id, location, description, and location` attributes
- Data imported to MongoDB Atlas using the provided `import.js` script
- objects are named `photos`
- `/api/v0/photos` returns an array of objects
- `/api/v0/photos/:id` fails to return anything at the moment
